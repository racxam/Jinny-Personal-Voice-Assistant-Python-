# Jinny-Personal-Voice-Assistant-Python-
This is my personal voice assistant jinny, it can do tasks with voice commands

Jinny will open with a voice "Twinkle Twinkle" or "twinkle" only.
Jinny will then open and greet me by my name and you can also feed your name in code.
Then a sound will start before listening,after that you are supposed to give commands to personal assistant jinny
Jinny can do following tasks:
1.ask about his name
2.you can appriciate his name
3.You can ask about his food that what do he eat
4.You can open gmail, youtube,outlook,facebook,smtv,google in your default browser in my case it is safari aftet changing the path you can use this in your laptop
5.You can ask him to play music and you can also ask about time
6.you can ask him to open apps like vscode,chrome browser
7.you can say quit, leave, close to stop the assitant
8.if you use vulgalar language then it will not respond and exit automatically
9.If you him any command which is not feeded in him then it will use google search 
10.Also You search anything in wikipedia and it will read 2 lines for you and you just have to say that search this thing in wikipedia.


If you wants to use this in your laptop/pc then you have to change some paths becuase these paths that i have used is according to my Mac

1.pyttsx3--For text to speech conversion
2.speechRecognition- For converting voice into strings
3.pyaudio-Which is used in speechReconition
4.datetime- to Get the date and time
5.wikipedia- to search in wikipedia
6.Subprocess- It's like the os module in windows ,i used it to open files from mac
7.playsound - To play sounds
8.webbrowser- to browse something in browser
